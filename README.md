# Epidemic-Outbreak-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

To conclude, this report is focused on presenting trends and forecast in the
Indian region with respect to the outbreak of COVID-19. Although the growth rate is not at par with 
growth rate at World Level, but the situation would have been very dangerous as India was heading 
towards exponential growth before lock-down  was announced.


The current trend shows that there will be a linear trend continued in the next few days as the 
control mechanisms taken by the Government of India are fairly strict and working well for the time 
being. Also, with linear trends, the patients getting recovered can be managed easily and death 
rate can be controlled as well. Hospital provisions and medical facility enhancement work should be 
continued at a very rapid pace to prepare the country for exponential growth, if it occurs. 
However, with current interventions and preparations, the Government of India is looking forward to 
flatten the curve.


In the case of a regression model, different features can be used for decaying or intervention  eg. 
the number of cases recovered  etc.,  but growth of the regression line still remains a problem. 
For a regression model, we always need to train the model after some time with the change in trend 
in the data.


In this study, we have only predicted the number  of confirmed cases. To predict the number of 
death cases we faced many  problems  of data stationarity. Also, with limited data, the model was 
not able to predict the number of death cases properly. We have used only time series data for 
confirmed cases and death cases in this study.  Using other data related to weather, geographic 
layout of the country, state-level population and governance parameters, the
model prediction rate can be further improved.
